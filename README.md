This is a laravel portfolio project created by 
## Kristen Ann Joy F. Luciano (Kirl/Kirlsten)

The goal of this project is to display my skills as a Software Engineer, including my experience, my other side projects, etc.

At the moment, this project will have a main home page for public view, a single page showcase of introduction, skills, career, experiences, and projects

For future updates, there will be a backend side with authentication and sections with CRUD operations to manage the skills and experiences in the main page dynamically. 

There might also be a local api for other data to load

Integration to other future projects are also the option.
